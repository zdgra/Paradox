# Paradox

This past February, I entered GameDev Knights' Spring Jam 2021 - my very first game jam. Prior to this game jam, I had not made a single game or even touched Unity. All I knew coming into it was that I wanted to make games, and this was my opportunity to make one! I wanted to join a team that already had programmers, so I could learn from them. However, this was not the case...

When everyone made their pitches, I gravitated to one team: Team Paradox. When I talked to them, I quickly learned one thing: they did not have any programmers, and I would be the lead programmer if I chose to join their team. The idea of this petrified me! Still, I wanted to work on this project because it interested me, and I decided that I would join the team. I certainly did not dismiss, however, the fact that I would not learning from other experienced programmers as I had hoped, and I would be learning by myself in these 48 hours.

And yet, I did it! It is one of the most hectic, adrenaline-rushing weekends of my entire life, and I look back on this experience fondly. What I am most proud of this entire experience is how fast I was able to learn and pick up Unity and C#. I used my knowledge of object-oriented programming to learn how to make different objects and scripts interact in Unity.

The most gratifying part of this experience came from the final stretch: it was less than an hour before the game jam ended, and one of the members on my team was already getting ready to upload our game in case it needed time to upload. Our game still did not have (1) a timer, which was crucial for our game's idea of starting over to create a *time paradox* when the player did not escape the room in time and (2) the door lock did not yet interact with both the key and the timer. As the clock was ticking and tocking, I used everything I had learned about objects and scripts interacting in Unity to create variables, attach them to objects and scripts, and have those objects and scripts interact. My blood was *pumping*! And in time, I was able to get everything working and have those components of our game in place! It was so, so gratifying to have learned everything I did in the past 2 days and have it culminate in that very satisfying moment.

And that was my first game and game jam! I look forward to making more games, joining more jams, and learning more things!
